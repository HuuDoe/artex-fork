# ARTEX Fork — Windsurf/Devin SWE-2 Integration

Fork of [ARTEX](https://github.com/konanguyen/ARTEX) with native **Devin SWE-2 model support** via reverse-engineered Codeium Connect protocol.

</div>

## What This Fork Adds

- **Windsurf LLM provider** (`norma/llm/windsurf/windsurf.go`) — direct protobuf-over-HTTP to `server.codeium.com`, bypassing the Devin agent harness. ARTEX's agent loop keeps full control over tool calling, message history, and system prompts.
- **SWE-2 models** — `swe-2-high`, `swe-2-medium`, `swe-2-max` as selectable LLM profiles.
- **CloakBrowser** — stealth Chromium with 87 C++ patches for evading bot detection.
- **Traffic capture fixes** — mitmproxy-based evidence collection for vulnerability findings.
- **Protocol docs** — full reverse-engineering writeup at [`docs/windsurf-integration.md`](docs/windsurf-integration.md), reusable for connecting SWE-2 to any tool.

## Fork Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose v2
- [Devin Pro](https://devin.ai) subscription (for SWE-2 — optional if using OpenAI/Anthropic)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HuuDoe/artex-fork.git
cd artex-fork

# Create .env (only POSTGRES_PASSWORD is required)
cat > .env <<'EOF'
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=artex-local-2026
EOF

# (Optional) Install Devin CLI and authenticate for SWE-2 support
curl -fsSL https://cli.devin.ai/install.sh | bash
devin auth login    # opens browser for Devin Pro auth

# Build and start
docker compose build    # ~6 min first time
docker compose up -d
```

Or use the automated script: `./setup.sh` (handles all of the above interactively).

**Web UI:** http://localhost:8787 — login with `ARTEX` / `ARTEX`

### Adding SWE-2 as an LLM Profile

1. Go to **System → LLM Profiles** → **Add Profile**
2. Set **Provider** to `windsurf`
3. Set **Model** to `swe-2-high` (or `swe-2-medium` / `swe-2-max`)
4. Leave **API Key** empty — it reads from your Devin credentials automatically
5. Click **Test**, then **Save**

The Windsurf provider reads `windsurf_api_key` from `~/.local/share/devin/credentials.toml` on your host, which is mounted read-only into the container by `docker-compose.yml`.

### Using Without SWE-2

Skip the Devin CLI step. Configure OpenAI or Anthropic profiles instead:

1. Add your API key to `.env` (`OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...`)
2. Or add profiles through the web UI under **System → LLM Profiles**

### How the Windsurf Integration Works

```
ARTEX agent loop  →  Windsurf provider (Go)  →  server.codeium.com
                     hand-rolled protobuf         GetChatMessage (streaming)
                     windsurf-api-key header       returns deltas + tool calls
```

No `.proto` files — all protobuf encoding is hand-rolled (~70 lines). No Devin harness in the loop. Full protocol specification: [`docs/windsurf-integration.md`](docs/windsurf-integration.md).

### Docker Compose Override (Optional)

The base `docker-compose.yml` handles everything including Devin credential mounts. A `docker-compose.override.yml` is only needed if your Devin CLI is at a non-standard path or you need to run the `devin` binary inside the container:

```bash
cp docker-compose.override.yml.example docker-compose.override.yml
# Edit DEVIN_CLI_BIN / DEVIN_DATA_DIR paths if needed
```

## Approval record details

The global **Approval Records** page, the per-task **Intercept Approval** tab, and approval cards in chat all support expanding to view details. The layout follows the approval detail component of
[AegisHook](https://github.com/RuoJi6/AegisHook/blob/main/web/src/components/CallDetail.vue), reusing ARTEX's own components and theme:


## Asset sync (ScopeSentry)

Asset data can be synced directly from [ScopeSentry](https://github.com/Autumn-27/ScopeSentry), avoiding duplicate collection:

- On the **Asset Sync** page, enter the ScopeSentry address and API Key to connect the data source;
- Select targets and asset types (domain / subdomain / IP / port / site / endpoint…) by **project** or **task** dimension;
- Import in one click and merge by company asset scope, ready for agents to explore in ARTEX's asset graph.

---

## Installation

> Requires **PostgreSQL**; exploration requires an **LLM** (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or configure it in the UI).

### Option 1: One-click install script (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mhtsec/ARTEX.git
cd ARTEX
./install.sh
```

The script detects / auto-installs Docker, then lets you pick **① all in Docker** or **② run locally**:

- **① All in Docker**: enter a Postgres password (press Enter for a random one) → it writes `.env` → `docker compose up -d`.
- **② Local run**: choose a database (connect to an existing one / spin one up with Docker) → generate `config.json` → build an embedded single Go binary → start.

After installation open **http://localhost:8787** (first visit to `/setup` sets the admin password).

### Option 2: Docker Compose (manual)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mhtsec/ARTEX.git
cd ARTEX
cp .env.example .env          # set POSTGRES_PASSWORD, optionally ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
docker compose up -d          # pulls the mianhuatang11/artex image + postgres
# → http://localhost:8787
```

> The original image `autumn27/artex` has been removed from Docker Hub; images are now self-maintained by this repository as **`mianhuatang11/artex`**.
> If the registry is unavailable (or you want to modify the code), just build locally from pure source: `docker compose build && docker compose up -d`.
> The Dockerfile is a multi-stage build (frontend static export → Go static build → runtime image) and defaults to China-friendly dependency mirrors; add `--build-arg GOPROXY=... / --build-arg NPM_REGISTRY=...` to override.

The image already includes common tools (ripgrep/curl/vim/npm/nmap…); `./skills` and `./data` are bind-mounted for persistence.

Remote MCP in system settings supports `http` (Streamable HTTP) or `sse` (legacy SSE).
Legacy SSE servers usually establish an event stream with `GET /sse`, then receive JSON-RPC requests via the `/message?sessionId=...` URL returned by the service; set the URL to `/sse` and fill the request header as
`Authorization=Bearer <token>`.

### Option 3: Download prebuilt binaries (Releases)

Download the zip for your platform from the original repository's [Releases](https://github.com/Autumn-27/ARTEX/releases) (**this backup repository does not host binaries**; if the original Releases are also gone use Option 2 or 4). After extraction you get `artex` + `start.sh` (`start.bat` on Windows) + `skills/` + `config.example.json`:

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json   # fill in the database connection
./start.sh                           # → http://localhost:8787
```

> Use `start.sh` / `start.bat` to launch instead of running `./artex` directly. It is a supervisor script: after the program exits it decides based on the exit code whether to relaunch, and the in-page
>[one-click update](#option-1-one-click-update-from-the-ui-recommended) relies on it to swap the binary. If you run `./artex` directly it won't be restarted after an update.
> Run in the background: `nohup ./start.sh >artex.log 2>&1 &`.

### Option 4: Build a single binary from source

```bash
# 1) Static export of the frontend
cd web && npm ci && npm run build:static && cd ..
# 2) Copy into the embed directory
cp -r web/out server/webui/dist
# 3) Build (-tags embedui embeds the frontend)
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -tags embedui -o artex ./cmd/artex
./start.sh
```

### Option 5: Build cross-platform release archives

`build.sh` builds and embeds the frontend, strips debug info using the Go linker, and zips the release files. In release mode it generates zips for Linux amd64/arm64, macOS amd64/arm64 and Windows amd64 by default:

```bash
./build.sh --release
# artifacts: dist/artex-0.3.3-*.zip
```

UPX-packed self-extracting binaries may be incompatible with some Linux kernels, virtualized environments or security policies, so they are disabled by default. Use `ARTEX_TARGETS` to customize targets; if you have confirmed the target environment is compatible you can pass `--upx` explicitly for a smaller binary:

```bash
ARTEX_TARGETS=linux/amd64,windows/amd64 ./build.sh --release
./build.sh --target linux/amd64 --upx
```

---

## Updating

> An upgrade replaces the program only, not the data: the Postgres volume `pgdata`, `./data` (jwt.key / SQLite, etc.) and `./skills` are all preserved. **No manual database migration is needed** — `artex` idempotently re-runs `schema.sql` (including `ADD COLUMN` / `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`) on every startup, i.e. "restart = migrate". Back up `./data` and the database before upgrading anyway.

### Option 1: One-click update from the UI (recommended)

In the **System Configuration** page (sidebar "System Configuration" → `/system/settings`), the **Version & Update** card can check for and install new versions without logging into the server.

Click "Update" and ARTEX downloads the release package for the current platform → verifies it against the Release's `SHA256SUMS` → smoke-tests the new binary with `-h` → stages it as `artex.new` → the program exits and `start.sh` / `start.bat` relaunches it to complete the swap. The page waits for the new version to come up and then refreshes.

- **A failure never leaves a broken program behind**: if verification or the smoke test fails, the staged file is discarded and the current version keeps running; if the swapped-in version fails to start 3 times in a row it automatically rolls back to `artex.old` (the failed binary is kept as `artex.failed` for troubleshooting).
- **Roll back any time**: the previous version is kept as `artex.old`, and the card has a "Roll back to previous version" button. Note that database schema changes are not reverted.
- **Updates interrupt running tasks** — an update is a restart, so run it when idle.
- **Development builds get no updates**: this is disabled when the version is `dev` or `git describe` output has a suffix, so release builds cannot overwrite a locally debugged binary.
- **Under Docker only the program is replaced, not the image**: tools like playwright / nmap inside the image are not upgraded, and rebuilding the container with `docker compose up -d` falls back to the version baked into the image. To upgrade the image too, use `docker compose pull artex && docker compose up -d artex`.
- If access to GitHub requires a proxy, configure a **global proxy** on the same page and the update chain will use it. Updates only download from GitHub domains and force HTTPS.

### Option 2: One-click update script

```bash
cd ARTEX
./update.sh
```

The script optionally runs `git pull` first, then lets you choose **① Docker update** or **② local build update** (mirroring `install.sh`):

- **① Docker**: optionally specify the target image tag (press Enter to keep `.env`'s `ARTEX_TAG`, default `latest`) → `docker compose pull` → `docker compose up -d` (restarting with the new image migrates the schema automatically).
- **② Local**: rebuild the frontend static output → recompile `./artex` (takes effect after a restart).

### Option 3: Docker Compose (manual)

```bash
cd ARTEX
git pull                       # update compose / scripts (optional)
# pin a version: set ARTEX_TAG=v0.2.0 in .env; latest is used if unset
docker compose pull artex
docker compose up -d artex     # restart with the new image → auto-migrate schema
docker image prune -f          # clean up old images (optional)
```

### Option 4: Prebuilt binaries (Releases)

Download the new version's zip from [Releases](https://github.com/Autumn-27/ARTEX/releases), stop the old process, overwrite `artex` and `skills/` (keep your `config.json` and `data/`), then restart:

```bash
cp -r <extracted>/skills ./ && cp <extracted>/artex ./
./start.sh
```

### Option 5: Build from source

```bash
git pull
cd web && npm ci && npm run build:static && cd ..
cp -r web/out server/webui/dist
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -tags embedui -o artex ./cmd/artex
# restart ./start.sh
```

---

## Configuration

**Database** (`config.json`, or override with the `ARTEX_PG_DSN` environment variable):

```json
{
  "database": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1", "port": 5432,
    "user": "artex", "password": "yourpass",
    "dbname": "artex", "sslmode": "disable"
  }
}
```

**LLM**: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...` (or `OPENAI_API_KEY`); it can also be filled in on the "LLM Configuration" page in the UI.
Optional: `ARTEX_LLM_PROVIDER` / `ARTEX_LLM_MODEL` / `ARTEX_LLM_BASE_URL` / `ARTEX_LLM_PROXY`.

**Concurrency**: the number of work agents per task is configured in "System Settings" (default 3).

**Common flags**: `./start.sh -addr :8787 -proxy :8788` (`-addr` serves the frontend + API, `-proxy` is the traffic recording proxy). The start script passes flags through to `artex` verbatim.

### Reverse proxy deployment (HTTPS / only 443 exposed)

The frontend and the API/SSE are both served by the same backend port (default `:8787`), and the live activity stream uses **same-origin** URLs by default, so there is **no need to set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SSE_BASE`** — you can expose only 443 publicly and keep 8787 on the internal network.

SSE is a long-lived connection with continuous pushes, so the reverse proxy **must disable buffering**, otherwise the browser connects but never receives events (the activity stream just spins forever). Nginx example:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name your.domain.com;
    # ssl_certificate / ssl_certificate_key ...

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8787;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # Key SSE settings: no buffering, long timeout, HTTP/1.1
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_cache off;
        proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Connection "";
    }
}
```

> Only set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SSE_BASE` **at build time** when SSE must use a different origin from the page (e.g. a separate subdomain); that variable is baked into the static bundle by `next build`, so setting it at container runtime has no effect.

---



## Development

### Manual vulnerability retest

The "Retest" tab on a task detail page lets you paginate through the task's vulnerabilities, review past verdicts and evidence, and start a retest manually. After starting it the current tab is kept, showing a spinner and "Retesting"; once the fix is confirmed the vulnerability status is updated accordingly.

Click "Retest" in the action area of each row of the vulnerability list, or click "Start retest" in the "Vulnerability Retest" area of the vulnerability detail, then fill in the optional fixed version, test conditions or limitations. The system creates an independent retest agent session and keeps the current page on start. Flat list, per-task grouping and asset views all expose this entry point; while a retest is running a spinner and "Retesting" are shown, and clicking through lets you open the corresponding session, with the label returning to "Retest" afterwards. Retesting does not require restarting the original scanning task; verdicts are "Still reproducible", "Fixed" or "Unable to confirm", and each round's verdict, evidence and session link are stored in the vulnerability detail.

On first startup the new backend seeds an editable "Vulnerability Retest" (`retester`) agent; its prompt, LLM, run budget and tools can be configured in Agent management. It uses its bound LLM by default, falling back to the global active configuration. When a retest session completes successfully with the verdict "Fixed", the system automatically sets the vulnerability's remediation status to "Fixed"; while running, on failure, on stop, or with any other verdict the original status is kept. Original evidence and reports are always preserved. You can also set "Fixed" manually from the status dropdown. If the same vulnerability is already being retested the existing session is reused, and after a stop, failure or service restart a new retest can be started.

In this version the history is viewed through vulnerability details and sessions; it is not yet included in vulnerability report exports or task archives, and is not automatically linked to traffic captures. Demo mode only generates clearly labeled mock records and never touches real targets.

### Local development and testing

```bash
./dev.sh    # backend(:8787) + traffic proxy(:8788) + frontend next dev(:5173) → http://localhost:5173
```

- Backend: `go run ./cmd/artex` (without `-tags embedui` the frontend is not embedded)
- Frontend: `cd web && npm run dev` (`/api` is proxied to the backend, with hot reload)
- Tests: `go test ./...`
- Mock preview (no backend): `cd web && NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK=1 npm run dev`
- Redeploying the online demo (Cloudflare Pages, static export + mock data):
  ```bash
  cd web && NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK=1 npm run build:static
  CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=<token> npx wrangler pages deploy out --project-name=artex-demo --branch=main
  ```

## System architecture

ARTEX is an **LLM multi-agent autonomous penetration testing system**: a monolithic Go backend (with the Next.js frontend embedded) + PostgreSQL, where agent capabilities come from the [`norma`](https://github.com/Autumn-27/norma) SDK (`agentcore` / `tool` / `permission` / `harness` / `memory` / `transcript`). At its core is a **dual-graph architecture**, plus two autonomy mechanisms built around it: **process-level information exchange between workers** and a **planner multi-round shared todolist that stabilizes attack chains**.

### Dual-graph architecture: exploration graph + asset graph

The system splits "**what the target is**" and "**how far testing has gone**" into two mutually independent graphs connected by anchors:

- **Asset graph (global, shared)**: a single source of truth for assets across tasks. Nodes are `root_domain / subdomain / ip / service / app / endpoint` and belong to a company; parent-child relations and dedup keys from domain → subdomain → service → endpoint are all computed by the program, and agents only submit raw information.
- **Exploration graph (per task)**: the "thinking and progress" of a single task. Nodes are `goal / intent / fact / finding / hint`, connected by edges such as `spawns / derived_from / yields / proves` into **blood-lineage chains**, answering "which direction was derived from which facts, and what did it produce".
- **The two graphs are linked by anchors**: `exploration_anchors(node_id, asset_id)` anchors intents/facts/findings to concrete assets — so you can go from an "exploration direction" to the assets it targets, and from "a given asset" back to which intents tested it in this task and which facts came out. This also powers **asset test coverage** and the **asset coverage map** (in-scope assets with tested ones highlighted).

```mermaid

```

> Division of labour: the **planner** reads the exploration graph's state, judges objectives, and only dispatches **intents** into the frontier when there is an uncovered direction; a **worker** claims **one intent**, executes it with real tools, writes new assets/facts/findings back to both graphs and stops. The asset graph is shared fact; the exploration graph is each task's progress chain.

### Engine and intent lifecycle (the closed loop of one exploration)

The engine is an **event-driven** closed loop: any graph change wakes the planner, the planner dispatches intents, a worker claims an intent, executes it and writes back, and the write-back triggers the next round — until the goal is proven (`prove_goal`).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant EV as graph change debounce
  participant P as planner
  participant FR as frontier intent queue
  participant W as worker
  participant PX as recording proxy
  participant DB as dual graphs + activity

  EV-->>P: wake up
  P->>DB: read state (graph_overview prefetch + coverage/scope)
  P->>FR: dispatch 0..N intents (with asset_ids)
  Note over P,FR: Most wake-ups dispatch 0 — no new direction means done
  W->>FR: claimNext one intent
  W->>DB: fetch the raw assets for the intent's asset_ids as initial info
  W->>PX: real tool execution (Kali / Bash / HTTP)
  PX-->>W: response (fully traced + CA verification)
  W->>DB: write back fact / asset / finding + per-step activity
  DB-->>EV: graph change
  EV-->>P: wake up again (closed loop)
```

### Process-level information exchange between workers

During a deep exploration many valuable observations (an error, a response body, a hidden parameter) appear in one worker's **execution process** without necessarily being written as a formal fact. To avoid duplicated work and let workers on the chain stand on each other's shoulders, workers can **retrieve processes across works**:

- `search_all_worker_traces(q)`: keyword search across the **execution processes of other works in this task** (automatically excludes the steps of its own intent); hits carry `intent_id`;
- `list_worker_traces` / `get_worker_trace(intent_id, step_ids=[…])`: first see which works have run, then fetch the full content of specific steps of a work for detailed exchange.

So even when the exploration graph has no corresponding fact yet, later workers can reuse observations from others' processes — **information flows between workers at the granularity of "execution process"**, while the boundary stays unchanged (each worker still only does the intent it claimed).

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  WA["worker A (intent #12)"] -->|"per-step activity"| ACT[("Exploration graph · activity process store")]
  WB["worker B (intent #34)"] -->|"per-step activity"| ACT
  WC["worker C (intent #56)"] ==>|"1) search_all_worker_traces(q)"| ACT
  ACT ==>|"2) hits in A/B's steps (excluding self)"| WC
  WC ==>|"3) get_worker_trace(id, step_ids)"| ACT
  ACT ==>|"4) returns full process content"| WC
```

### Planner multi-round shared todolist → stable attack chains

Real attack chains are usually **multi-step sequences with dependencies** (e.g. find an injection point → obtain credentials → lateral movement → privilege escalation); dispatching all of them in parallel at once just falls apart. The planner therefore holds a **planning todolist that persists per task and is shared across wake-ups**:

- the planner is event-driven — it is woken whenever the graph changes, but **each wake-up is a brand-new session**; the shared todolist lets it record a serial exploitation chain **once**, then across subsequent rounds **dispatch intents step by step in dependency order** instead of expanding the entire chain in a single round;
- each round only dispatches intents for the next step whose **predecessor is done and whose required facts already exist**, updating the list as it goes (marking steps already satisfied by facts as complete).

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph TODO["Shared todolist (persists per task · resident across wake-ups)"]
    direction LR
    T1["1 Injection point　[done]"]
    T2["2 Get credentials　[in progress]"]
    T3["3 Lateral movement　[blocked]"]
    T4["4 Privilege escalation　[blocked]"]
    T1 -.dependency met.-> T2 -.-> T3 -.-> T4
  end
  R1["Wake-up 1　dispatch intent ①"] --> T1
  R2["Wake-up 2 (① produced fact)　dispatch intent ②"] --> T2
  R3["Wake-up 3 (② produced fact)　dispatch intent ③"] --> T3
```

So attack chains still **advance stably, without duplication or misordering** in an "event-driven + stateless session" environment — this is the key to ARTEX autonomously completing multi-step exploitation chains.
